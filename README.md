## Schema examples

While working with the Mapping of Mappings, we encounter several different schemas for geospatial data.
Some are happily already `GeoJSON` or other geospatial data formats, others have to be manually scraped and transformed.

This repository contains examples to work on.

## Licence

We cannot apply a licence, as we don't know about the licence of the sources, either.
